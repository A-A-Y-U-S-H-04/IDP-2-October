Shifting Gears! This project was very enjoyable as I was able to portray floating gears. For this project I updated the transparency of the background, becaue it makes the gears look like they are kind of being distorted. It gives the gears a cool look. I used fucntions, loops, and variables to make this porject come to fruition. Something new that I learned is that I can use the push and pop funtion to add more elements to the code. There are many elements that I updated such as the contituents under the draw gear funtions; I used translate, map, and noise fucntions.
